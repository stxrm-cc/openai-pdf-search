# openai-pdf-search

Find instances of a string (word, phrase... mostly words for now) in a defined number of PDF (more formats to come) documents, using AI to eliminate the occurences of the term you're looking for that are likely to be irrelevant.

Requires an OpenAI subscription since a free plan limits your requests made to 3/min.
